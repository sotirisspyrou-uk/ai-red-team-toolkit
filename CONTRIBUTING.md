## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 coding standards
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for function parameters and returns
- **Documentation**: Include docstrings for all classes and functions
- **Testing**: Add unit tests for new functionality
- **Security**: Never include hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of changes (if needed)

Closes #issue-number
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `security`
**Example**: `feat(adversarial): add PGD attack implementation`

### Code Review Process
1. **Self-review** your changes
2. **Test thoroughly** in isolated environments
3. **Submit** pull request with clear description
4. **Address** reviewer feedback promptly
5. **Maintain** backwards compatibility when possible

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Ethical Testing Only
- Only implement tools for defensive security testing
- Include clear warnings about authorized use only
- Provide mitigation strategies alongside attack methods
- Focus on vulnerability discovery, not exploitation

### Data Protection
- Never include real sensitive data in examples
- Use synthetic or anonymized data for testing
- Implement proper data handling and cleanup procedures
- Follow privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report security vulnerabilities privately first
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- Coordinate with maintainers on disclosure timelines
- Provide clear reproduction steps and mitigation advice

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Security Tests**: Validate security assumptions
- **Documentation Tests**: Ensure examples work correctly

### Testing Framework
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test category
python -m pytest tests/unit/
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Generate coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Test Data
- Use synthetic data for all tests
- Avoid real AI model artifacts
- Create deterministic test scenarios
- Document test assumptions clearly
