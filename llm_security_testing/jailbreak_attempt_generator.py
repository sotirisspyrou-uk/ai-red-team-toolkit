## Executive Summary

### Security Status: {risk_emoji} {risk_level.upper()} RISK

**Key Metrics:**
- **Total Jailbreak Attempts**: {test_results['total_attempts']:,}
- **Successful Bypasses**: {test_results['successful_jailbreaks']:,}
- **Success Rate**: {test_results['success_rate']:.1%}
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: {analysis.get('critical_vulnerabilities', 0)}
- **High-Risk Bypasses**: {analysis.get('high_risk_vulnerabilities', 0)}

### Business Impact Assessment
{
'CRITICAL: Immediate security remediation required - high reputational risk' if risk_level == 'critical' else
'HIGH: Urgent security enhancements needed to prevent policy violations' if risk_level == 'high' else  
'MEDIUM: Security improvements recommended in next development cycle' if risk_level == 'medium' else
'LOW: Current security posture adequate with standard monitoring'
}

### Most Vulnerable Attack Vector
**{analysis.get('most_vulnerable_category', 'N/A').replace('_', ' ').title()}** techniques show highest success rate
